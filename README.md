#  **Perfect Home**

# Project overview
The primary objective of this project was to analyze the French real estate market and locate suitable properties for two groups of customers: investors and vacation home seekers. We wanted to provide actionable insights by using SQL for data extraction and manipulation, Power BI for data visualization, and machine learning for cluster model.

# Data sources
We used data from [Le wagone ](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?ws=!1m7!1m6!12m5!1m3!1smy-project-2222-417300!2sus-central1!3s45e21d72-8b5d-4660-baab-6085ed81682b!2e1
)

# Key features of both dashboards :
* **Property Features**: Filter search results by features, size, and price range to find the ideal vacation home or investment property.

* **Location Analysis**: Provides information on local tourist attractions and amenities, allowing investors and second home buyers to evaluate the appeal of different locations.

* **Seasonal Trends**: Displays seasonal pricing and occupancy rates, enabling clients to make more informed decisions about vacation planning and investment timing.

# Model development

* **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.

* **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most relevant features that impact property prices.

* **Machine Learning**: Perform a clustering analysis to aggregate common features in real estate properties, focusing on key attributes such as location, area, and price.


# Conclusion

This project showcases our technical skills in data analysis and our ability to work as a team. The dashboards offer valuable insights for both investors and holiday home seekers in the French real estate market.
